# Kernels for Amazfit watches
### Development of working kernel sources for Amazfit watches

This project aims at developing working open source kernels for all the Amazfit smart-watches. Such kernel sources will help the community develop/port other popular Softwares for the Amazfit devices.

In the main branch (here) are the Ingenic's Newton 2 Plus kernel-3.10.14 sources. Newton 2 Plus is a development board which have many similarities with the Amazfit smart-watches, thus we will base our kernels on these sources. The sources were pull from [ingenic's git server](http://git.ingenic.com.cn:8082/) for use with Amazfit ingenic products.

### Progress

| Platform | Status  | Branch Link |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Pace     | boots   | [pace-mods-development](https://github.com/amazfitDev/platform_kernel-3.10.14/tree/pace-mods-development) |
| Stratos  | -       | -           |
| Verge    | -       | -           |

*hopfully we will have only one source/branch for all on the future*
