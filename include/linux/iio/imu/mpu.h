 * struct mpu_platform_data - Platform data for the mpu driver

 * @magn_orient:	Orientation matrix of the magnetometer
 * @gyro_orient:	Orientation matrix of the gyroscope

 * @wake_delay_max:	Maximum waking delay of the SensorHub
 *
 * Contains platform specific information on how to configure the MPU to work
 * on this platform. The orientation matricies are 3x3 rotation matricies that
 * are applied to the data to rotate from the mounting orientation to the
 * platform orientation.  The values must be one of 0, 1, or -1 and each row and
 * column should have exactly 1 non-zero value.
